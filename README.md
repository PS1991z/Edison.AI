# Edison.AI
I'm the creator of Edison.AI — a cutting-edge mobile app built to democratize the patent process and make innovation accessible to everyone, including kids and first-time inventors.

Powered by Ollama, Edison.AI uses a local LLM to:

Transform user-submitted ideas into structured draft patent applications

Conduct and display prior art searches

Provide relevant references and an AI-based valuation model to help users assess their idea’s potential

As a former USPTO Patent Examiner, I designed Edison.AI with real-world experience in mind — helping bridge the gap between inspiration and protection. My mission is to inspire inventors, simplify the legal complexity, and guide everyday creators toward turning their ideas into million-dollar patents.
