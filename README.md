# Edison.AI

I'm the creator of Edison.AI — a cutting-edge mobile app designed to democratize the patent process and make innovation accessible to everyone, including children and first-time inventors.

Powered by Ollama, Edison.AI uses a local LLM to:

Transform user-submitted ideas into structured draft patent applications

Conduct and display prior art searches

Provide relevant references and an AI-based valuation model to estimate idea potential

To make the process engaging, Edison.AI is gamified — encouraging users to brainstorm, level up their ideas, and progress through the invention process like a creative journey. This motivates users to not only submit but refine their ideas and move toward real-world patenting.

As a former USPTO Patent Examiner, I designed Edison.AI to turn insights from the patent world into a tool that inspires innovation, simplifies complexity, and helps everyday creators turn their ideas into million-dollar patents.
